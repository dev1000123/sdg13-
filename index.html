    <h3>Climate Action</h3>
    <p>According to UNDP, climate action “means stepped-up efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and strengthen
   resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-induced impacts, including: climate-related hazards in all countries;
   integrating climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning; and improving education, 
  awareness-raising and human and institutional capacity with respect to climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning.”</p>

    The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015,
     provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future
     . At its heart are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are an urgent call for action by all 
     countries - developed and developing - in a global partnership. They recognize that ending poverty and other 
     deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, 
     and spur economic growth – all while tackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests.</b></section>
